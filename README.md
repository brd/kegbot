Flow management recording for an Arduino Mega with an Ethernet Shield


Parts needed:

Arduino Mega: http://www.adafruit.com/product/191

Ethernet Shield: http://www.adafruit.com/product/201

Flow Meters: http://www.adafruit.com/products/828


The code will track how much liquid flows through the flow meters.  The values can then be accessed via HTTP as a JSON response.  It will also store the values to the SD Card.
